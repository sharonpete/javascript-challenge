javascript homework - javascript and DOM manipulation

## development notes
- starting with UFO-1.  
- Using the UFO dataset, write code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
- Note to self:  creating an HTML table by hand is possible, but way too much work, too error prone.  With some digging, found a much cleaner approach as reflected in the function createTable.  All of the day is showing up on the web page.
- The Button and the Form are working using d3.select.  Collecting the actual value entered by the user.
- Added a filter to filter by the entered date.  Works.  So far.
